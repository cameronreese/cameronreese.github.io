Coding is an amazing magical thing. Coding lets you accomplish so much, and sometimes, with so little effort. Coding allows complex problems to be broken into simple workable set that when chained together produces an orchestra of solutions.

Then there is the reality, we don't decide our coding fate. More often than not, the codebase you are working in, is actively working against you. A set of contradictory requirements with unrealistic expectations are usually the marching orders set before you.  Of course, anything is possible, so its usually worth a try even though you don't even know what you don't know, but given the promise that you can do anything with code, than surely it is possible some how some way.

We theorize coding in the perfect conditions that exist of its potential. However, if we were to do true introspection into our coding experience, we would realize that in almost every case that we are tasked to code, it is never the ideal situation, that more often than not, we find ourselves coding uphill.
